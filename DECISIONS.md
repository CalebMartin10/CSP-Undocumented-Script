For the first two functions in refactored_script I decided to use list comprehensions to replace the functionality that was there before. For the first function, multiply_parities, it reduced the size of the function and allowed the use of try & except blocks which made it easier to understand and debug (it also fails gracefully now). For the second function, concatencate_mixed_case, it allowed the usage of a try & except block to catch errors. It also split the function logic into two parts (making words all upper or lower case then combining them into a sentence) which makes it easier to understand.

I also decided to rename the functions to make them more descriptive. Function names were renamed to give a breif description of what they do (the first function multiplies numbers based on their parity and the second concatenates words and makes a mixed case sentence). Variable were renamed to better reflect what they are or what they hold (num = nubmers and list_of_numbers = a list containing numbers).

I also added comments throughout the refactored_script file to aid any developers who may try to understand this module. Doc strings were added to describe the parameters, return values, and uses of each function. Inline comments were added to quickly summarize lengthy or complex parts of code.
